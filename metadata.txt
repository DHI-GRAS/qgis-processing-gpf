name=Processing BEAM and S-1 Toolbox Provider
description= QGIS Processing provider for GPF-based algorithms (BEAM and Sentinel-1 Toolbox). 

about= 
	QGIS Processing provider for GPF (Graph Processing Framework)-based algorithms. Currently supports selected algorithms from BEAM (http://www.brockmann-consult.de/cms/web/beam/) and Sentinel-1 Toolbox (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-1). In the future support will be extended to other Sentinel Toolboxes (https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes). 
	
	The plugin requires BEAM and/or S-1 Toolbox to be installed for it to be able to access their GPF algorithms. 
	
	This plugin is part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) developed under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.
